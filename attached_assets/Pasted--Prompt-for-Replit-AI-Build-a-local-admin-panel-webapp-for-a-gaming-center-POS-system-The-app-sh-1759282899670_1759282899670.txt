Build a local admin panel webapp for a gaming center POS system.
The app should run locally on the shop‚Äôs computer (using React + Tailwind CSS for frontend, Node.js + Express for backend, and SQLite for database).

The Admin Panel should have these features:

1. Settings Page

Admin can add how many PCs, PS5s, Car simulators, and VR simulators are available.

System should auto-generate seat names like PC-1, PC-2 ‚Ä¶, PS5-1, PS5-2 ‚Ä¶.

Admin can toggle seats as visible or hidden (if under maintenance).

Admin can set pricing per category (PC/PS5/VR/Car).

Pricing should support multiple time slots (e.g., PC ‚Üí 30 mins = ‚Çπ40, 1 hr = ‚Çπ70, 2 hr = ‚Çπ130).

Pricing should be editable at any time.



2. Seat Management

Show all seats with live status: Available, Running, Expired, or Upcoming Booking.

When session starts, show countdown timer.

When time expires, trigger:

Popup alert: ‚ÄúPC-3 session ended‚Äù

Sound notification

Seat status changes to Expired


Admin can Extend Session (choose another time slot) or End Session.



3. Walk-in vs Upcoming Booking

Dashboard should have two tabs:

Walk-in List: sessions that started instantly at counter.

Upcoming Booking List: sessions booked in advance.


Walk-in tab shows seat name, customer name, start time, end time, time left, price, and status.

Upcoming tab shows seat name, booking time/date, customer name, duration, price, and payment status.

Upcoming bookings should move to Walk-in automatically when session starts.

Alerts should also appear when a booking is about to start (10 mins before).



4. Reports

Track daily, weekly, and monthly revenue.

Export reports to Excel and PDF (use SheetJS for Excel, jsPDF/pdfmake for PDF).

Keep booking history stored locally in database.



5. Local System

No internet required. All data stored in SQLite.

App should run at http://localhost:3000/admin.

Optional: allow other PCs on LAN to connect (http://local-ip:3000/admin).
